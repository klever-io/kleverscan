# Contributing to KleverScan

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KleverScan! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started.

## Getting Started

To get started contributing, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`. (If you don't have Yarn installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g yarn`. We use Yarn instead of raw npm to manage dependencies.)
3. Start the development server by running `yarn dev`.
4. Make your changes and test them locally.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## Code Style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce a consistent code style. Husky automatically runs Prettier on all staged files before committing them, so you don't need to worry about it.

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Please make sure your changes include tests and that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

As of now (10/10/2023) we are currently working on adding tests to the project. If you would like to help out with this, please feel free to open a pull request!

## Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug or issue with the project, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Please include a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. You can also open a pull request with a fix for the issue or message us on our [Forum](https://forum.klever.org/).
